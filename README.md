# handwritten_hyperparam_transfer
Can smaller, more complex handwritten character classification tasks be used to efficiently find optimal hyperparameters for larger datasets? Final project for USC CS467.

Requirements for the environment can be found in `requirements.txt`, and `results.ipynb` contains the code to reproduce the paper results.
